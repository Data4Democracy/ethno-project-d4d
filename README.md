# ethno-project-d4d
Many people outside of academia are unfamiliar with ethnography and how to use it to understand people and cultures. The purpose of this project is to open source that process so that those without formal training can participate and we can gain deeper insight into questions that are socially relevant across a wide variety of places and cultures.
