# ethno-project-d4d
This is an ethnographic research project, seeking to understand how people trust information and decide what to share online.  How do people consume information and determine its reliability?  How do the format and language of news, the channels through which it arrives, and the social, political, and cultural context of the consumer influence its perceived legitimacy?

In addition, many people outside of academia are unfamiliar with ethnography and how to use it to understand people and cultures. Another goal of this project is to open source that process so that those without formal training can participate and we can gain deeper insight into questions that are socially relevant across a wide variety of places and cultures.
